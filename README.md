# We're disrupting capitalism
_Our mission is disruption of capitalism's dominant model, as we assert most people lose while only a very minority win. We're confident 'social entrepreneurs' agree [1]._

## Research: computational fluid dynamics
We think we're researching potentially a 'high-impact' topic that could bring health equity to millions of less-fortunate people. Our current research below supports this, with preliminary findings that significant increases in Personal Protective Equipment effectiveness are possible with small (& not un-conventional) optimisations to their design. 

Our evidence is based on a purely computational methodology, with it's real-world accuracy supported by supplementary activities in 'validation' against a recent physical investigation [2], and 'verification' across computational investigations (establishing relative invariance of computational results to differing numerical parameters). 

## Development: ideation to optimisation
We aim to encourage collaboration, to disrupt the individualist mindset [3]. We further propose a design methodology which couples the computational-based method we've used with human-based 'ideation' techniques. Such an approach of optimisation conducted on a wide idea space ensures premature optimisation is reduced, allowing greater probability of achieving breakthrough innovations (based on a 'rational argument' and not physical empirical evidence).
